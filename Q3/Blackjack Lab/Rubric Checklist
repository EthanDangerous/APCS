game ends when player stands or goes over 21 (done, if they stand they are unable to hit again or stand again...
..., if they go over 21 then they cannot hit or stand unless you get a new hand or reset)
lose message (done, if the player busts when they have 0 points then they get a lose message and can only reset the full game)

challenge:
add sounds (done, there are around 5 sounds for various effects)

note:
if a player gets a new hand without standing first, the game will attempt to score
it regardless. if no points can be gained it does nothing, otherwise it gives you
the correct amount (though you still lose a point for getting a new hand,
so it may feel like you are getting on less point)
